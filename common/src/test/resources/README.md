Lightbend Scala Language - Professional / Lightbend Scala Language - Professional

Please start sbt.

In the course presentation video recordings the instructor uses a `man e` command in the sbt interactive session to display exercise instructions. 

The LSL-P-lightbend-scala-language-professional.zip you downloaded does not contain the man e exercise instructions. 

In this course the exercise instructions are included in Academy alongside the exercise introduction and exercise review video recordings.

Please refer to the Academy instructions on order to complete the exercise.
